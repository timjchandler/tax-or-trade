# Tax or Trade

The java model may be run via the Python Notebook ```run.ipynb``` found in the ```analysis``` directory. For comparisons between tax and trade models, ```combine.ipynb``` may be run.

Alternatively the model can be run directly from the command line.

## ```run.ipynb```

This notebook contains five runnable cells.  

#### Cell 1

Here the relevant libraries are imported and the variables are set.  
The variables may be set as follows:


#### Cell 2

The model is run through the command line. The first two rebuild the model from its source and may be commented out if no changes have been made.  
Note: To build the model Maven is required, instructions on installing it may be found [here](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

#### Cell 3

Here the data from the model is plotted as area plots for both tax and trade. For each, a plot of electricity production and CO2 emissions are generated.

#### Cell 4

Here a comparison is plotted between the overall electricity and CO2 production of each model.

#### Cell 5

The ```.csv``` files generated by the model are removed.
